Extras
======

There have been a lot of other wonderful changes as well, and fortunately,
there are a lot of great places to learn about them.

New in Symfony 2.2 Blog Series
------------------------------

First, Fabien did a fantastic job with a series of blog posts called
`What's new in Symfony 2.2`_, which you can find by looking back at December
2012 and January and February of 2013. One of my favorites is the new `Stopwatch`_
component, which let's you add your own events that live in the timeline.
Actually, this was possible in Symfony 2.1, but now the code is a component
and available for anyone to use.

Tracking Changes: CHANGELOG, UPGRADE
------------------------------------

For other changes, check out the `CHANGELOG`_ and `UPGRADE`_ files on the
Symfony repository itself. The `CHANGELOG`_ contains updates between minor
releases, and eventually will get quite long. So pour a pint and treat yourself
to an exciting read. And actually, each individual component and bundle also has
its own ``CHANGELOG``. To see what's new in the `HttpFoundation`_ component,
`look right inside of it`_.

That's it! Symfony 2.2 is a great new release with more features and minor
backwards compatibility breaks. If you're still relatively new to Symfony,
check out our `Starting in Symfony2`_ series and then start coding!

See ya next time!
